# Binary-Image-Classifier-using-Numpy

This is a simple N layer neural network created by only using numpy. It classifies an image as a cat or non cat image.


The main code is in the Deep Neural Network.ipynb and the various functions are in functions.py file.

The function 'L_ layer_model' in Deep Neural Network.ipynb has been used to create the neural network.
The main funactions that were used were forward propagation, back propagation , gradient decent.

# Result
My model has given an accuracy of 98.6 % on the training set and on the testing set I achived an accuracy of 80 %.
